            <p>A Game Designer, Web Developer, and Programmer - as well as a Third-Year student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) 
                persuing a Bachelor of Science in Game Design and Development. I'm also an Eagle Scout and active member of 
                numerous campus activities, including serving as the Vice-President of Battery for the RIT Drumline for my second year.

            <p class="leftAligned clearLeft">
                Games are obviously a passion of mine - from board and card games, tabletop roleplaying games, and other physical games to 
                strategy, puzzle, shooter, and other video games. I've spent three years on the RIT Competitive Halo Team, as well as played 
                in and run many roleplaying game systems for friends. Games are a large part of my life and I love finding out about new ones, 
                so feel free to tell me about anything you know of! You can also see what I've been playing recently on my 
                <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sgedelta/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.

            <h2 class="leftAligned clearLeft">Music</h2>
            <p class="leftAligned clearLeft">
                In addition to Programming and Game Design, I also love making and producing music. While I haven't released anything yet, 
                it is a passion that I'm exploring through my music Immersion at RIT. I look forward to eventually making and releasing my own
                music soon!
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="leftAligned clearLeft">Clubs and Activities</h2>
            <p class="leftAligned clearLeft">
                I take part in multiple Clubs on RIT's Campus - mostly music related. I play as a percussionist in RIT's Pep Band at Hockey Games, 
                and as part of RIT's Game Symphony Orchestra. I also serve as the Vice-President of battery for the RIT Drumline, where I teach 
                others how to march and play various instruments, help plan and execute our custom written show, and make sure that we are competition ready.

            <p>Aspera is a Scifi-Fantasy Tabletop Roleplaying Game that I developed with a team as part of a class at RIT. 
                Over the course of a semester, we took a concept from a single page of notes to an entire published book. 
                After the semester was over, we continued to develop the game and grow the system further.

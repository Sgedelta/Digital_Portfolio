    <h2>Welcome to Herder!</h2>
    <p>Herder is a Game where you attempt to protect your Herd from a swarm of increasingly aggressive Hunters. You can't control your Herd, but you can protect them! Keep your Herd as large for as long as possible to try and beat your High Score!</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>Everything made by me, using the Circle Blast Homework as a starting point. Sound effects made using <a href = "https://sfxr.me/">jsfxr</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id = "howTo">
    <p>Click on Hunters as they approach your Herd to kill them. Your Herd will grow when the Eat the Food spawned randomly across the screen. Hunters will speed up and spawn more of themselves for every five members of your Herd they Eat. More Hunters and more Food will spawn when all Hunters are eliminated. You get a Bonus to your Score when you lose a member of your Herd after your Herd reaches it's largest size. The larger your Herd, the more Hunters will spawn!</p>
